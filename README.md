# Abstract

In recent years, the field of Machine Learning has experienced significant growth, becoming
increasingly prominent in our daily lives. In this context, it is necessary to pay
attention to analyzing the performance of a classification model as it is a critical phase in
the development and perception of errors.

This dissertation addresses the challenge of evaluating classifiers applied to geospatial
datasets, with a focus on the Almada region. The motivation behind this stems from
the necessity to develop an effective interactive visualization tool aimed at assisting
users in selecting the most suitable classifier based on their specific needs and contextual
understanding.

To develop such a solution, comprehensive research was required on the concepts
of machine learning, as well as the strengths and weaknesses associated with the use of
different metrics for evaluation, emphasizing the importance of considering the spatial
dimension when evaluating the classifier. Finally, given the nature of the multi-class
problem and the solution being proposed, it was also necessary to carry out a study to
understand which algorithms are best and the respective fundamentals of interactive data
visualization.

To overcome the limitations associated with conventional means of assessment, we
propose the development of an interactive visualization tool that integrates various evaluation
techniques, including dynamic confusion matrices, metrics, and spatial maps. The
tool allows users to explore the dataset, the individual performance of different classifiers
at various thresholds, and make an in-depth comparison between them, contributing to an
effective understanding of the errors made by each classifier and their spatial distribution.

Through empirical evaluation, it was possible to test the developed tool, thereby
identifying its limitations and potential future enhancements.

Thus, this dissertation contributes to the advancement of geospatial data analysis,
providing users, professionals and scientists, with a tool capable of evaluating different
classifiers so that they can make informed decisions.
